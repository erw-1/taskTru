# taskTru

**taskTru** is a Windows utility that lets you make task windows click-through, topmost and transparent.

Perfect for PIP (Picture In Picture) apps & anything you want to overlay over your apps!

## Features
- **Click-Through**: pass mouse clicks through the specified window and disables its interactions.
- **TopMost**: keep your selected windows on top of all other windows.
- **Opacity**: set transparency from 0% to 100% with a slider.
  
Everything above is toggleable and can be set for several windows at a time, the task list can be refreshed.
